TECHNICAL TEST LETGO
=====================

## Specs

- The gallery should load a small subset of images and load more via pagination or infinite scroll technique.
- The gallery should be able to show owner's username that point to the original image post and the image caption on mouse hover event as the example shows.
- On image click a responsive lightbox should be opened with all image information that you can include.
- The backend must be responsible to (a) serve the SPA (HTML files and CSS+JS bundles that conforms the app) and (b) act as an API to retrieve the images.
- The backend API must retrieve the images through the Flickr API.
- The app must be a SPA. The first request to the webserver should return the SPA code. Subsequent interactions shouldnâ€™t make requests to the webserver, only to the API to request data.
- Backend must be implemented with NodeJS. Additionally, you can also use the ExpressJS or, any other, framework you consider.
- Commit your progress so we can see how you work. You can use github or bitbucket. If use a private repositories give us access to see your work. If you make a public repository, please, do not make any reference indicating it is a test for letgo.
